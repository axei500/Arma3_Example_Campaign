# Intro
I made this repo to help myself and new editors, create missions/campaigns in Arma3. I just starded on it myself, spent like 20 hours making a mission with a lot of triggers. You can defenetly make a mission this way, but its a lot easier if you use sqf scripts. In this example i will add some basic scripts, that i think are usefull for my upcoming campaign. I will also try setting up a campaign ware optinal objectives have an effect in the next mission.

## Content
Right now this repo contains a basic script called by radio trigger. This script wil tell a soldier(He starts in a animated state) to get in a car with a driver(already in it), when he is in a follow cam will follow the car. the car will drop off the soldier and then the soldier will move to a location. 

Now a convoy script the get out doesnt work yet
