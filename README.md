# Intro
I made this repo to help myself and new editors, create missions/campaigns in Arma3. I just starded on it myself, spent like 20 hours making a mission with a lot of triggers. You can defenetly make a mission this way, but its a lot easier if you use sqf scripts. In this example i will add some basic scripts, that i think are usefull for my upcoming campaign. I will also try setting up a campaign ware optinal objectives have an effect in the next mission.

Now i have decided to use CUP collection because it contains a lot of iconic vehicles like the humvee. Also has landing craft for naval invasions. Contains a ton of maps. https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=583575232, i plan to include a script for naval landigs so this is required to load all assets, not required for the scripts and functions.

Some functions see function viewer for description

Right now this repo contains a basic script called by radio trigger. This script wil tell a soldier(He starts in a animated state) to get in a car with a driver(already in it), when he is in a follow cam will follow the car. the car will drop off the soldier and then the soldier will move to a location. 

Now a convoy script the get out doesnt work yet
